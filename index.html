                The PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game (TCG) has become more than just a hobby itâ€™s now a serious market where cards are treated as collectibles with real value. 
                However, most existing online platforms don't meet the specific needs of PokÃ©mon card collectors and sellers. Websites like eBay or Facebook Marketplace often have high fees, 
                fake cards, and no proper system for verifying sellers or the cards themselves. This makes trading risky and frustrating for many people.<br><br>
        
                Because of this, thereâ€™s a clear need for a trusted and secure online space made especially for PokÃ©mon card enthusiasts. This study aims to build a platform that solves these problems. 
                By having an admin manage all listings, verifying the cards, and using smart contracts for secure transactions, the platform will offer safer buying, selling, and auctioning of PokÃ©mon cards.<br><br> 
                It will also reduce scams, lower fees, and give users more confidence in each trade.
        
                This project is important because it creates a better experience for the PokÃ©mon TCG community by giving them a platform they can rely on one that protects both the buyer and the seller, 
                and keeps everything fair and transparent.

                    For this project, we chose to implement a relational database due to its structured nature, 
                    data integrity, and ability to efficiently handle complex relationships between entities. 
                    The platform involves various interconnected components such as users, PokÃ©mon cards, 
                    auctions, bids, and transactions, all of which require consistent and reliable linking through primary and foreign keys. 
                    A relational database provides a logical, organized way to manage these relationships while ensuring data accuracy and referential integrity. 
                    Additionally, the use of SQL allows us to perform powerful queries to support features like real-time bidding, user reputation tracking, 
                    and secure transaction logging. This makes relational databases like MySQL the ideal choice for building a scalable, secure, 
                    and data-driven marketplace system.
